        "\n",
        "A *region* is a **large geographical area** where a cloud provider hosts its services.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **1.2 Availability Zone (AZ)**\n",
        "\n",
        "An AZ is a **physically separate location inside a region**, with its own power, cooling, and networking.\n",
