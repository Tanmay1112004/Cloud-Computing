        "\n",
        "The video explains a **complete roadmap to learn Cloud Computing** from zero to pro. It highlights why cloud is booming (AI + ML need cloud hardware), covers prerequisites (networking, OS, Python, databases, virtualization), introduces major providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), explains core AWS services like EC2, S3, RDS, networking, and stresses hands-on practice. It ends with certifications and the importance of consistency.\n",
