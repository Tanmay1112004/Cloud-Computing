        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Cloud computing provides IT resources like servers, storage, and software over the internet on a pay-as-you-use model. It requires no upfront cost, supports instant setup, and offers very high scalability. Compared to traditional hosting like on-premises or dedicated hosting, cloud computing is faster to deploy, cheaper for most users, easier to scale, and reduces the need to manage hardware. It is ideal for startups, growing companies, and applications with fluctuating demand.\n",
