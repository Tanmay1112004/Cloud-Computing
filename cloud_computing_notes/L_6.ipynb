        "The video explains different **career options in cloud computing**, why cloud skills matter, and how cloud roles connect with software development, AI/ML, and data. It stresses that students should focus on **building skills first**, because cloud knowledge can open multiple job paths — Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Data Engineer, AI/ML Engineer, Web Developer (Cloud-based), etc. The video also shows how cloud tools (like AWS EC2, S3, SageMaker, Kubernetes) are used in real companies.\n",
